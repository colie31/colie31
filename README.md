# About Me
---

As an individual who loves to problem solve, I find a career in Software Engineering quite satisfying and fulfilling. I enjoy being challenged outside of my knowledge and comfort set. I am always looking to apply my skills as well as expand on them. A problem/issue gives an opportunity to learn and grow.
